* Global 500 Emissions Data (2011):

  https://data.cdp.net/Companies/2011-Global-500-Emissions-and-Response-Status/cxp6-pzzb



### I. Online Visualization: *2011-Global-500-Emissions-and-Response-Status*

* Navigate to database: [Link](https://data.cdp.net/Companies/2011-Global-500-Emissions-and-Response-Status/cxp6-pzzb)

* **View** data: https://data.cdp.net/Companies/2011-Global-500-Emissions-and-Response-Status/cxp6-pzzb/data

* **Sort** data: on `Performance Band`

* **Filter** data: `Country is USA`

* **Visualize** data:

  * Column plot of `Mean` `Disclosure Score` by `country`
  * Histogram of `Disclosure score` 
  * Histogram of `Disclosure score` , filtered for `Counttry is USA`
  * Point Map of `Count of rows`

  â€‹


##### Review: 

* No need for additional software; all in browser (+)

* Low learning curve (+)

* Restricted to pre-packaged tools (-)

* Can't combine datasets (what about 2012, 2013?) (-)

  * **Aggregate** data (Pivot Tables)
    * Mean `Disclosure Score` by `Country`
      * Add `Permission` as sub column
    * Set `Permissions` as row
  * **Visualize** data:
    - Column plot of `Mean` `Disclosure Score` by `country`
